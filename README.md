# Graph-Library
Graph data structure implemented in c++ with all basic functions and operations on graph

An abstract base class Graph is used to model a graph. The derived classes DirectedGraph and UndirectedGraph inherit from class Graph.

Currently added features:

1)Create a Graph with N vertices.

2)Add an unweighted edge between two vertices u,v.

3)Add a weighted edge between two vertices u,v.

4)Traverse the Graph using BFS or DFS.

5)Check if the Graph is cyclic.
